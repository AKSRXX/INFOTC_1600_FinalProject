# My Ideal Lifestyle

## Where Do I Wish to Live


I always wanted to live in a big populated city such as New York, Los Angeles, Kansas City, or whereever it may be.

I like the idea of big city living because of the ammentities it offers such as
* Plenty of Convenience Stores
* The absence of small town gossip
* Variety
* Apartments
* Job envirements

I grew up in a small town and did not quite enjoy the way it was ran. It relied on who knew who and how long you lived there.
Small towns are not as open to change as well.

## House or Apartment?


I like living in an apartment. I lived in one in all my years of college and do not plan on changing that after I graduate.

I am more of a minimalist and like small spaces. I want a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment with a small kitchen. I think of a home as a place

to recharge. A simple bed and black furniture would suffice. A place for my collectables would be ideal.

## Transportation


I would not mind if I only owned a bike but it does not seem ideal to me since it could cause trouble when trying to visit family.

I currently have a 2004 Ford Escape which gets the job done but my dream car is a newer Toyota Tundra. Toyota Tundras a beauty to me in

a way that I cannot put into words unfortunatly.
